My first vue.js-project. It involves some nice features like vueX and sass-support and it is build with the vue CLI. Under the hood it uses Webpack to bundle all the code. 

## Next steps 

- load data (JSON) asynchronously instead of importing it
- view loader if data is not ready
- deploy to Github Pages
